          Whoops! is a story you can take part in about making mistakes on the
          internet. Or you could call it a "public shaming simulator"
        </p>
        <p class="main">
          It's about what happens when we act poorly, say or do occasional
          stupid things that used to be in front of a handful of people we now
          broadcast to potential audiences of millions. Are our cultural tools
          regulating public behaviour fit for the internet age? Do we as a
          society have the right tools to manage debate about controversial
          topics online?
